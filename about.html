            <p>We are passionate about content marketing. That's why you're here. Because you'd like to be, too.</p>
            <p>We are a full service content-marketing agency, and we can work on your company as per the goals you
                want to achieve. We are always available to work through things with you and make sure we're aligned to
                achieve the best results. Content strategy involves a lot of figuring out what works best for you and
                your company, and we are prompt in turnaround times and honest in our feedback - both qualities that we
                feel are extremely necessary in a content strategy + marketing agency.</p>
            <p>We are making sure good writers and content creators get their due, and that our clients get the kind of
                good work they deserve.</p>
            <p>Because we are freelance content marketers and creators ourselves and we know the kind of effort it
                takes to make a mark in the world, and we've worked with clients who have told us that they often are
                unable to find good creatives who can deliver the kind of quality they are looking for.
            </p>
            <p>We're here to bridge that gap. If you're an impeccable writer and a bit of a grammar nazi, we want you.
                If you're a company who needs good content and hasn't gotten lucky yet, your luck awaits.
            </p>
            <p>Writers, fill up this <a href="writer.html">form</a>, and if you'd like us to work on your content
                strategy, fill up <a href="content.html">this one.</a>
