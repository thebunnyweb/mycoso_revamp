            <p>Mycoso Media ("us", "we", or "our") operates the www.mycosomedia.com website (the "Service").We are very
                sensitive to the privacy needs of its website visitors and users and recognize the importance of
                protecting personally identifiable information that You may choose to share with Mycoso Media.</p>

            <p>This Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") provides You with important information regarding Mycoso
                Media's work, security, loyalty and many personally identifiable information related to its goal.</p>

            <p>We will not use or share your personal information to anyone by breaking the rules and regulations
                mentioned in the "Privacy Policy".</p>
            <p>We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you
                agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined
                in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and
                Conditions, accessible at www.mycosomedia.com </p>


            <p class="s-head"><b>Registration Information:</b></p>

            <p>Mycoso Media never automatically collects any information that specifically identifies Users, such as
                their name, address, or e-mail address. Mycoso Media collects personally identifiable information from
                Users only when Users voluntarily provide it as part of the registration process ("Registration
                Information") to open an Account. We always ask Users whenever we need Registration Information that
                identifies Users or allows us to contact Users.</p>

            <p>Mycoso Media may collect and use personally identifiable information from Users for purposes other than
                to open an Account, e.g., such as subscribing to a newsletter, participating in polls, surveys, and
                questionnaires, using tell-a-friend features, participating in contests, sweepstakes, or other
                promotions, or receiving technical support.</p>

            <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information
                that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is
                not limited to, your name, phone number, postal address and other information ("Personal Information").</p>

            <p>It may be used for better understanding of your connections with our Website, advertising or research
                purposes.</p>

            <p class="s-head"><b>Consent and Security:</b></p>

                Registration Information is required in order for Mycoso Media to provide You with services - namely,
                access to and/or participation in Jobs, to post Jobs and receive Writer Services, and certain other
                features of the Website.</p>


            <p class="s-head"><b>Use of Personally Identifiable Information:</b></p>

                billing purposes. In addition, Mycoso Media reserves the right to disclose Your personally identifiable
                information under limited circumstances in the event Mycoso Media believes that the Website is being
                used to commit unlawful acts; if disclosure of Your personally identifiable information is required to
                comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order; or will help to
