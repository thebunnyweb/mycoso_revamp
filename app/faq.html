            <p>Hi and welcome to Mycoso! We hope these FAQs clarify some of the doubts you may have. If you have any
                doubts that aren't addressed here, feel free to reach out at hello@mycoso.com</p>

                    <p class="a-title">How does Mycoso work?</p>
                    <p class="a-text">We are a content solutions agency. That means we cover everything related to
                        content marketing for our clients. It depends on what the client needs - a full blown content
                        solutions package, a content marketing plan, or blog posts for their website. Check out our <a href="services.html">Services Page</a>. As of now, we only need freelancers to write for our clients,
                        but the rate at which we're growing, you may be able to do more, if you're so inclined! We'll
                        keep you updated about that :)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="a-title">How is the price set?</p>
                    <p class="a-text">The price depends on the depth of research required and will be negotiated by
                        Mycoso with the client, irrespective of whether they are standalone articles or part of a
                        package. We value our expertise and yours as well. Plus, when we have a job available, you'll
                        see how much money you'd be able to make if you choose to do it. So essentially, you pick the
                        price you're willing to write for!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="a-title">Why should I work through Mycoso?</p>
                    <p class="a-text">We've been freelancers. We know pitching is hard. You needn't do that here. We
                        are the ones responsible for bringing on clients. All you have to do is write! Makes it easier
                        for you, right? And as a freelancer, we know that it's good to have a choice of platforms and
                        clients available. Mo' choices, mo' money!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="a-title">Is my payment guaranteed in a fixed amount of time? Freelancers often face lax
                        timings in terms of payments.</p>
                    <p class="a-text">Oh, we know that issue very well. Mycoso charges 50% to clients upfront as soon
                        as the project starts. We also ensure that the final service we provide is only released once
                        the payment comes in. We will see your progress, though. So you can't slack off! Rest assured,
                        Mycoso will provide the final delivery to the client only once the full payment is made. Once
                        they are satisfied,and corrections (if any) are done, the payment will be released to you!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="a-title">Will I get all the projects I apply for?</p>
                    <p class="a-text">If you're the best person for the project, absolutely! What's great is that there
                        will be a variety of industries and sectors, so you can pick and choose what you do best. We
                        also absolutely encourage branching out. If you really would like to work in a project outside
                        your area of expertise, reach out and we'll see what we can do!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="a-title">Why do you have a test before I can start applying for work?</p>
                    <p class="a-text">It's a pretty basic thing and it's just for us to ensure you're able to do a
                        pretty good job. Efficiency is our God, and we would rather have awesome writers like you
                        associated with Mycoso. We don't want to turn into a free-for-all platform that cannot provide
                        assurance of quality. Wouldn't you prefer that as well? Don't worry, they won't be weird
                        questions about what a gerund or a dangling participle is. I'm sure some of us here don't know
                        what those are either.</p>

                <li>

                    <p class="a-text">We aren't thinking about that as of now. However, talk to us at <a href="mailto: hello@mycoso.com">hello@mycoso.com
                        and let us know what you're thinking. We'd love to have you on the list for (if and) when that
                        does happen!</a></p>

                        <p class="a-text">We are absolutely committed to making the internet a little better with smart strategy and people-oriented content. There are enough random posts out there that are just focused on clickbait and keyword stuffing. We don't do that and never will. We think long term and want to position your company as an institution to look up to. We make a real difference, and we're always honest about what we think is best for your company and its future. If you're looking for honest partners who want to see your company grow and will be there to tell you what's working and what isn't, you're in the right place.</p>

We are in the process of setting up encryption on the site to ensure that money transfers go through the website easily. As safety is paramount, we'd rather stick to our banking institutions as of now, till we have everything perfectly in place.</p>
